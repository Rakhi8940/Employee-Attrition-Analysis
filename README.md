# 👩‍💼 Employee Attrition Analysis – Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes patterns in employee data to predict and understand **employee attrition**—whether an employee is likely to leave the company. Using **classification algorithms**, we aim to identify the key factors influencing attrition and provide data-driven insights for HR decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict whether an employee will leave the organization (attrition)
- Analyze the impact of various features like job role, age, satisfaction, and salary on attrition
- Help HR teams identify at-risk employees and improve retention strategies

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Key Features**:
  - `Age`
  - `Attrition` (Target variable: Yes/No)
  - `JobRole`
  - `MonthlyIncome`
  - `OverTime`
  - `JobSatisfaction`
  - `YearsAtCompany`
  - `DistanceFromHome`
  - `EnvironmentSatisfaction`
  - `Education`, `MaritalStatus`, etc.

> 📌 Place the dataset as `employee_data.csv` inside the `data/` directory.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load data and check for missing values
   - Encode categorical features (Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding)
   - Normalize numerical features where appropriate

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze attrition distribution and class imbalance
   - Visualize patterns using heatmaps, box plots, bar plots
   - Understand relationships between features and attrition

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and test sets
   - Apply classification models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - XGBoost or Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
     - ROC-AUC Curve
   - Perform feature importance analysis to find key drivers of attrition

5. **Insights & Reporting**
   - Identify key features influencing employee churn
   - Recommend HR strategies to reduce attrition

6. **Optional Web Integration**
   - Create a simple **HTML/CSS interface** or **Flask app** to input employee data and predict attrition risk
